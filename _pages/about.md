title: "About me"
---

Hi! I'm **Zhang Yuxuan** (章宇轩), an undergraduate student currently studying at  
**School of Physics, Peking University**. And I'm also pursuing a double degree in **EECS**.

I’m currently interested in **computational neuroscience** and **theoretical physics**, particularly in understanding the emergent behavior of neural network, neural dynamics, and learning dynamics. Now I am studying in Louis Tao's Lab.  
This site is a collection of my thoughts and research.

My hobbies are diverse but not particularly deep in any. I’ve dabbled in photography and piano,  
and recently started learning the violin. I’ve always been an avid reader and a movie, manga, anime enthusiast.  
And trust me, my profile picture is almost a spitting image of me (before I decided to grow my hair long).

Feel free to contact me via [GitHub](https://github.com/Tomzyx0315) or
